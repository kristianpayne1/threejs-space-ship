### 🛠️ Develop

Install packages using:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a locally hosted instance of the app.

Any subsequent changes made inside the codebase will be immediately reflected upon save 🔥

### 🚀 Deploy

**Pre-requisite**: A GitHub account and a public repository is required.

Run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build and deploy the app onto [ GitHub Pages ](https://pages.github.com/).

The URL will be something like:

```aiignore
https://[ username ].github.io/[ project name ]
```

### Happy Coding! 🧑‍💻
